# LEM (Large Expressions Management)

This is a module for the `LEM` (Large Expressions Management) module. It contains the functions to deal with large expressions management. The module can be used to veil and unveil large expressions to avoid expression swell.

The module `SIG` (Signature) module is also contained in the `LEM` repository. It contains the functions and workarounds to calculate the signature of "almost" any kind of expression. The signature is a hashing value that can be used to calculate the similarity between two expressions, or to check how likely an expression is algebraically non-null (see Schwarz-Zippel Lemma).

The code in this repository is hopefully an improved version of the code provided in Wenqin Zhou's PhD thesis *Symbolic Computation Techniques for Solving Large Expressions*.

We would like to thank *Jacques Carette* for providing the original code that we used to develop this module.

## Installation

To install the module you must have first installed Maple. Then open the `PackAndGo.mw` file and use the `!!!` button to *execute the entire worksheet*.

Then test the module in a Maple worksheet or document by typing:

```
> LEM:-Info(LEM); # For Maple versions up to 2020
> LEM:-Info();    # For Maple versions starting from 2021
```

Alternatively, you can use one of the tests file provided in the `tests` folder. If the module is loaded without errors, it is done!

## Module description

If you want a full description of the `LEM` and `SIG` modules type:

```
> Describe(LEM);
> Describe(SIG);
```

This command will generate a brief description of the module and all the procedures and other objects present in `LEM.mpl` and `SIG.mpl` files.

## Usage

In case you have no time to read the description and realize how it should or should not work, refer to the files `Test_Maple2021minus.mw` and `Test_Maple2021plus.mw` in the `tests` folder.

### ðŸš§ Attention! ðŸš§

Maple object-oriented programming features have slightly changed in 2021, which online documentation states:

> As of Maple 2021, if the method has a formal parameter named `_self`, references to its object's local or exported variables may be written without prefixing them. That is, `_self:-variable` may be written as just `variable`. Maple will add the `self:-` prefix internally when the method is simplified.

> As of Maple 2021, a message-passing form of method call can be used, which will automatically pass the object as an argument if the method has a formal parameter named `_self`.

> Another way to invoke a method, similar to that used in other object-oriented languages, was introduced in Maple 2021. In this form, the object name is qualified by the method name, `object_name:-method_name(argument)` just as it can be in the function mechanism described above. However, the *object can be omitted from the argument sequence*.
